## Changelog
#### (18/08, 17:00) - Matthew
* The plane dimension class has had a complete change. You can now create any size plane required, including any position of the seats and number of columns per row. The piority seats can also be spread inbetween the normal seats as nessessary.
* It is initialized from a Cell[][] array containing each of the rows of the plane and in each row theCell[] array contains all of the seats (cells), including aisles or non-seats.
* This array can EASILY be created programmatically and siginificantly eases the process of working out the seating order.
